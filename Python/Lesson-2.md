# Python for Kids

## Lesson 2: Basic Arithmetic

**Objective:** Learn how to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

```python
# Store numbers in variables
a = 5
b = 3

# Calculate the sum of two numbers and print it
sum = a + b
print("The sum of the numbers is:", sum)

# Calculate the difference between the two numbers and print it
difference = a - b
print("The difference of the numbers is:", difference)

# Calculate the product of the two numbers and print it
product = a * b
print("The product of the numbers is:", product)

# Calculate the quotient when one number is divided by the other and print it
quotient = a / b
print("The quotient of the numbers is:", quotient)
```

In this exercise, children learn how to use the basic arithmetic operators:

- `+` for addition
- `-` for subtraction
- `*` for multiplication
- `/` for division

This example uses the same two numbers for all operations to make it easier to understand the different outcomes each operation produces.
