# Python for Kids

## Lesson 1: Print and Input

**Objective:** Learn how to print messages and get user input.

```python
# Practice printing to the console
print("Hello, what is your name?")

# Get user input and store it in a variable
name = input()

# Print a message that includes the user's name
print("Nice to meet you, " + name + "!")
```

## Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types
**Objective:** Understand what variables are and the different types of data.
```python
# Store numbers in variables
a = 5
b = 3

# Calculate the sum of two numbers and print it
sum = a + b
print("The sum of the numbers is:", sum)

# Practice with strings
favorite_color = input("What is your favorite color? ")
print(favorite_color + " is a beautiful color!")
```
